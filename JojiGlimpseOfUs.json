(Ooh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you're out of sight\nIn my mind\n[Chorus]\n'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinkin' of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHopin' I'll find a glimpse of us\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me he savors your glory\nDoes he laugh the way I did?\nIs this a part of your story?\nOne that I had never lived\nMaybe one day, you'll feel lonely\nAnd in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse\nMaybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you're out of sight\nIn my mind\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinkin' of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHopin' I'll find a glimpse of us\nSee Joji LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also like[Bridge]\nOoh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinkin' of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHopin' I'll find a glimpse of us137Embed"
